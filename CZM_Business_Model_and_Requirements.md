# C-ZERO Token — Business Model & Requirements Specification

**Document**: CZM-BRD-001
**Version**: 1.0
**Status**: Draft for Engineering
**Date**: 2026

---

## Part 1 ─ Business Model

### 1.1 Vision

C-ZERO is the infrastructure that **converts verified carbon reductions into a digital financial asset that global capital markets can trade directly**.

> "Carbon is the New Gold."

### 1.2 Value chain (5 stages)

```
Waste ──▶ Decomposition/treatment ──▶ Verified carbon credits ──▶ Digital assets (cNFT/ST) ──▶ DeFi/exchanges
                                          │                                │
                                          └─ ACR/Verra/CCP                 └─ $CZM utility token
```

| Stage | Activity | Actor | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Decomposition | Treatment of waste refrigerants, F-gas, used tyres, etc. | GreenScience (Korea) + Local ProjectCo | DRE measurements |
| 2. Verification | On-site VVB verification | DNV / SCS / Bureau Veritas | VVB certificate |
| 3. Registration | Registration with international registry | GreenScience + ACR/Verra | CCP label |
| 4. Tokenisation | cNFT issuance, $CZM as gas | C-ZERO ADGM Ltd | On-chain assets |
| 5. Distribution | DEX/DeFi trading, exchange listings | C-ZERO ADGM Ltd + market | Capital recovery |

### 1.3 Revenue streams (5)

| # | Source | Operator | Share (Y10 est.) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | cNFT sales (direct carbon credit sale) | US company | ~50% |
| 2 | $CZM token transaction fees | Dubai company | ~15% |
| 3 | DeFi protocol fees (cDEX, cLend) | Dubai company | ~12% |
| 4 | Technology licence royalty | Korean company | ~10% |
| 5 | EPC + equipment sales | Korean company | ~13% |

### 1.4 Stakeholders (3-Company SOTP)

| Company | Role | Token relationship |
|---|---|---|
| **GreenScience Co., Ltd.** (Korea) | Technology + carbon credits + US business | Revenue → cNFT, royalty → $CZM, IPO/Series A planned |
| **C-ZERO ADGM Ltd** (UAE) | $CZM issuance/operation, DeFi | Token issuer, VARA-licensed |
| **Planet Earth Corp** (US) | RWA SPV, STO issuance | Issuer of C-ZERO ST (security token) |

### 1.5 Token's business roles

$CZM is not just an "investment asset"; it simultaneously plays **5 roles**:

1. **Gas / Fee token** — used for gas in cNFT issuance/transfer and DeFi
2. **Node operator collateral** — Container Node operators must stake to mine
3. **Governance** — voting power when locked into veCZM (Phase 2)
4. **Cashflow asset** — protocol revenue distributed to holders (97% of price formation)
5. **Liquidity layer** — supplied to DeFi pools to drive trading

---

## Part 2 ─ Token Economic Model

### 2.1 Supply

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Total supply | 5,000,000,000 (5B) — Hard cap |
| Distribution schedule | Released gradually over 10 years |
| Decimals | 18 |
| Standard | ERC-20 |

### 2.2 Distribution (8 categories)

| Category | Share | Tokens (M) | Vesting |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mining rewards | 40% | 2,000 | Linear over 10 years |
| DeFi / ecosystem | 15% | 750 | Linear over 5 years |
| Foundation | 15% | 750 | 1y cliff + 3y vest |
| Partners | 10% | 500 | 2y cliff + 3y vest |
| Strategic (Series A) | 8% | 400 | 6mo cliff + 18mo vest |
| Public (public sale) | 5% | 250 | 3mo cliff + 12mo vest |
| Airdrop | 4% | 200 | Distributed over 2 years |
| Marketing | 3% | 150 | Distributed over 4 years |

### 2.3 TGE pricing (Series A-Heavy)

| Round | Price | Quantity | Raise |
|---|---|---|---|
| Seed | $0.150 | 70M | $10.5M |
| Series A | $0.200 | 130M | $26.0M |
| **Total** | **avg $0.183** | **200M** | **$36.5M (~₩47B)** |

### 2.4 Staking yield mechanism

```
yield_rate(P, pool) = R₀ × (P_TGE / P) × (pool_left / pool_init)
                    ≤ R₀ = 10% / month
                    → 0% / month  (auto-stops when pool is exhausted)
```

- Eligibility: TGE stakers only (whitelist)
- Pool cap: **200M $CZM** (4% of supply)
- Estimated time to drain pool: 4-6 months
- Long-term price impact: **-1.1%** (within market noise)

### 2.5 Buyback-and-burn

- 6% of carbon credit revenue used to buy $CZM on the market and permanently burn
- Y10 cumulative burn estimate: 970M (19% of total supply)

### 2.6 Long-term price equilibrium

| Scenario | Y10 price | Market cap | Cohort A (Seed) ROI |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bear | $0.45 | $884M | 4× |
| **Base** | **$1.73** | **$5.0B** | **16×** |
| Bull | $3.49 | $14.4B | 33× |

## Part 5 ─ External Integrations

### 5.1 Price Oracle

**Primary**: Chainlink Price Feed (CZM/USD)
- Use a self-hosted Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) oracle right after TGE
- Aggregation: Uniswap V3 + Coinbase International + Binance API (3-source average)
- Update frequency: 5 minutes
- Fallback: auto-pause if Chainlink feed becomes stale (>1 hour)

**Secondary**: Custom oracle with multisig confirmation
- 5-of-N price multisig (representatives from different exchanges)
- One price commit per day

### 5.2 KYC Oracle

| Provider | Role |
|---|---|
| Sumsub / Persona | KYC + AML screening |
| Chainalysis | Sanctions / AML risk scoring |
| Custom on-chain whitelist | Register approved addresses |

Workflow: off-chain KYC → approved → admin calls `setEligible()` / `setWhitelist()`

### 5.3 Carbon Credit Registries

| Registry | Role | Integration |
|---|---|---|
| ACR (American Carbon Registry) | ODS / F-Gas registration | API + manual verification |
| Verra VCS | Nature-based / process verification | API |
| ICVCM CCP | Quality label | Certificate PDF + on-chain hash |

When issuing a cNFT, the registry's serial number is included in metadata → on-chain proof.

### 5.4 Multi-chain bridges

| Bridge | Use |
|---|---|
| LayerZero | Base ↔ Ethereum (primary) |
| Wormhole | Base ↔ Solana (Phase 2) |
| Custom L3 bridge | Base ↔ C-ZERO L3 (Phase 2) |
